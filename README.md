# Data Analysis and Modeling Project README

This repository contains code snippets and explanations for various data analysis and modeling tasks. Each section below summarizes a specific code snippet or task along with its purpose.

## Code 1: Filling Null Values in a CSV File

- **Purpose**: This code demonstrates how to fill null values in a CSV file using Python and the pandas library. It provides a flexible approach for handling missing data in a dataset with columns like 'STATION,' 'Country/Region,' 'DATE,' 'Year,' 'Month,' 'Day,' 'PRCP,' 'TAVG,' 'TMAX,' and 'TMIN.'
- **Usage**: Replace 'your_data.csv' with your dataset file and customize the fill values as needed.

## Code 2: Linear Regression and Difference Visualization

- **Purpose**: This code performs linear regression on a dataset with columns 'Year,' 'Month,' 'Day,' 'PRCP,' 'TMAX,' 'TMIN,' and 'TAVG.' It includes training a Linear Regression model, making predictions, calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE), and visualizing the differences between predicted and real values.
- **Usage**: Replace the dataset file and customize the model as required.

## Code 3: XGBoost Regression and Difference Visualization

- **Purpose**: This code is similar to Code 2 but employs the XGBoost Regressor for regression tasks. It trains the model, computes MSE, and visualizes differences between predicted and real values.
- **Usage**: Replace the dataset file and customize the model as needed.

## Code 4: Identifying Columns with Many Null Values

- **Purpose**: This code identifies and lists columns in a dataset that contain more than 20,000 null (missing) values. It helps in pinpointing columns with substantial missing data.
- **Usage**: Replace 'weather.csv' with your dataset file and customize the threshold as required.

## Code 5: Heatmap for Visualizing Missing Data

- **Purpose**: This code generates a heatmap using the Seaborn library to visualize the presence of missing (null) values in a dataset. It aids in understanding the distribution of missing values across columns and rows.
- **Usage**: Replace 'weather' with your DataFrame and customize the visualization as needed.

Feel free to explore and adapt these code snippets to your specific data analysis and modeling projects.
