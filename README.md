## Introduction

This project focuses on data analysis and modeling tasks using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Seaborn. Each section below covers a specific aspect of the project.

## Data Preprocessing

### Code 1: Filling Null Values in a CSV File

- **Purpose**: This code demonstrates how to handle missing data by filling null values in a CSV file. It provides a flexible approach for dealing with columns like 'STATION,' 'Country/Region,' 'DATE,' 'Year,' 'Month,' 'Day,' 'PRCP,' 'TAVG,' 'TMAX,' and 'TMIN.'
- **Usage**: Replace 'your_data.csv' with your dataset file and customize the fill values as needed.

## Linear Regression

### Code 2: Linear Regression and Difference Visualization

- **Purpose**: This code performs linear regression on a dataset with columns 'Year,' 'Month,' 'Day,' 'PRCP,' 'TMAX,' 'TMIN,' and 'TAVG.' It includes training a Linear Regression model, making predictions, calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE), and visualizing the differences between predicted and real values.
- **Usage**: Replace the dataset file and customize the model as required.

## XGBoost Regression

### Code 3: XGBoost Regression and Difference Visualization

- **Purpose**: This code is similar to Code 2 but employs the XGBoost Regressor for regression tasks. It trains the model, computes MSE, and visualizes differences between predicted and real values.
- **Usage**: Replace the dataset file and customize the model as needed.

## Identifying Columns with Many Null Values

### Code 4: Identifying Columns with Many Null Values

- **Purpose**: This code identifies and lists columns in a dataset that contain more than 20,000 null (missing) values. It helps in pinpointing columns with substantial missing data.
- **Usage**: Replace 'weather.csv' with your dataset file and customize the threshold as required.

## Visualizing Missing Data

### Code 5: Heatmap for Visualizing Missing Data

- **Purpose**: This code generates a heatmap using the Seaborn library to visualize the presence of missing (null) values in a dataset. It aids in understanding the distribution of missing values across columns and rows.
- **Usage**: Replace 'weather' with your DataFrame and customize the visualization as needed.
